To install Node.js, Angular CLI, Visual Studio Code (VSCode), and run code from a GitHub repository, follow these steps:

Install Node.js:
Download and install Node.js from the official website: Node.js.
Install Angular CLI:
Open a terminal or command prompt.

Install Angular CLI globally by running the following command:

npm install -g @angular/cli

## Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode):
Download and install VSCode from the official website: Visual Studio Code.

##Clone a GitHub Repository:

Open VSCode.
Use the integrated terminal in VSCode or open a separate terminal.

## Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

git clone [https://github.com/username/repository.git](https://github.com/murshidrifay99/login.git)

## Navigate to the Cloned Repository:

Use the terminal to navigate into the cloned repository:

cd repository
Replace repository with the name of the repository.

## Install Dependencies (if needed):

If the repository contains a package.json file, install the dependencies by running:

npm install

## Run the Code:

Follow the instructions in the repository's README file or documentation to run the code. For Angular projects, you can use:

ng serve --open

This command will build the Angular application and open it in your default web browser.

##Access the Application:

Once the code is running, you can access the application in your web browser. For Angular applications, it will typically be available at http://localhost:4200/.


# Login

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
